Develop a geographic visualization of twitter data across the USA.

Will need to use dictionaries, lists, and data abstraction techniques to create a modular program.

The geographic visualization will show how people in different states feel about a certain state. The image will be generated by:

Collecting public Twitter posts (tweets) that have been tagged with geographic locations and filtering for 
those that contain the state name query term

Assigning a sentiment (positive or negative) to each tweet, based on all of the words it contains

Aggregating tweets by the state with the closest geographic center

Coloring each state according to the aggregate sentiment of its tweets. Red means positive sentiment; blue means negative.

Project Goal: Map the sentiment of any word or phrase.
